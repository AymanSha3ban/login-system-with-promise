# Simple Login System using JavaScript (Promise & Async/Await)

This is a simple login system built using Vanilla JavaScript to demonstrate how Promises and Async/Await work in real-world scenarios.

## Features

* Simulated login authentication using Promise
* Async/Await for handling asynchronous operations
* Loading indicator while waiting for response
* Basic form validation
* Clean and simple UI

## How it works

* User enters username and password
* A loading message appears
* The system simulates a server request using Promise and setTimeout
* If the credentials are correct, a success message appears
* Otherwise, an error message is shown

## Technologies Used

* HTML
* CSS
* JavaScript (Promise, Async/Await, DOM)

## Purpose

This project was created as a practice project to understand asynchronous JavaScript concepts and improve frontend development skills.
